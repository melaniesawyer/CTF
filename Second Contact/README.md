# Second Contact

**Category:** Network Security
**Description:**

> As you're bumming around the Kuiper belt, you catch an incoming transmission from a distant source. They seem to be scanning the area, looking for something... Maybe you should try to find it first. This trace file is also available in cloudshark [here](http://www.cloudshark.org/captures/f0741cdfee53)

## Hint
> Look for packets going to and from a search engine - the key is the name of the author of the thing they're looking for!
